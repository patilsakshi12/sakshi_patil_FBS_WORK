MySQL Assignment -1 (DDL)

1. Login to MySQL and view all databases already present. You should get
following result :

mysql> show databases;

2. Write an SQL statement to create a simple table countries including columns
country_id,country_name and region_id. After this display the structure of
table as below :

mysql> create table countries(
    -> country_id int(11),
    -> country_name varchar(20),
    -> region_id int(11));

mysql> desc countries;

3. Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns
job_id, job_title, min_salary, max_salary and check whether the max_salary amount exceeding the upper limit 25000. Also set job_id as
primary key and entering null values for job_title is not allowed.

mysql> create table jobs(
    -> job_id int primary key,
    -> job_title varchar(25) not null,
    -> min_salary decimal(7,2),
    -> max_salary decimal(7,2) check(max_salary <= 25000));

4. Write a SQL statement to create a table named job_histry including columns
employee_id, start_date, end_date, job_id and department_id

mysql> create table job_histry(
    -> employee_id int,
    -> start_date date,
    -> end_date date,
    -> job_id int,
    -> department_id int);

5. Write an SQL statement to alter a table named countries to make sure that no
duplicate data against column country_id will be allowed at the time of
insertion.

mysql> alter table countries
    -> add constraint unique(country_id);

6. Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns job_id,
job_title, min_salary and max_salary, and make sure that, the default value
for job_title is blank and min_salary is 8000 and max_salary is NULL will be
entered automatically at the time of insertion if no value assigned for the
specified columns.

mysql> create table jobs(
    -> job_id int primary key,
    -> job_title varchar(25) default '',
    -> min_salary decimal(7,2) default 8000,
    -> max_salary decimal(7,2) default Null);

7. Create a Department table with following structure

mysql> create table department1(
    -> department_id decimal(4,0) not null default 0,
    -> department_name varchar(30) not null,
    -> manager_id decimal(6,0) not null default 0,
    -> location_id decimal(4,0),
    -> primary key(department_id, manager_id));

8. Write an SQL statement to create a table employees including columns
employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number hire_date, job_id,
salary, commission, manager_id and department_id and make sure that, the
employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of
insertion and the foreign key columns combined by department_id and
manager_id columns contain only those unique combination values, which

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id     INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name      VARCHAR(50),
    last_name       VARCHAR(50),
    email           VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number    VARCHAR(20),
    hire_date       DATE,
    job_id          VARCHAR(10),
    salary          DECIMAL(10,2),
    commission      DECIMAL(5,2),
    manager_id      INT,
    department_id   INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (department_id, manager_id)
        REFERENCES departments(department_id, manager_id)
);
